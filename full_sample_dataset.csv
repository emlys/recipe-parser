,,,"Tilt the wok carefully one side at a time so the oil distributes around the perimeter of the fish, including the head and the tail."

,,,Chill and marinate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
,,,"Prepare your grill for high, direct heat with one part of the grill for lower, indirect heat."
,,,The grill is hot enough when you hold your hand about an inch over the hot side and you can only hold it there for about a second.
,,,"Grill the steak: Remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess marinade from the steak (but make sure there is still a coating of it, you'll want the oil on it to help keep the steak from sticking to the grill)."
,,,"If you want, sprinkle generously on all sides with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper."

,,,"Rest the steak: When the steak has cooked to your preferred level of doneness, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board."
,,,Cover with aluminum foil to hold in the heat while the steak rests for 10 to 15 minutes.
,,,Slice across the grain: Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat.
,,,Flank steak is a very lean cut that will be tough and chewy unless you cut it in a way that breaks up the muscle fibers.
,,,"So, cut the steak across the grain of the meat, at a steep diagonal, so that the slices are wide."
,,,"I find it easiest to use a long serrated bread knife for this, but any long sharp knife will do."
,,,"If you want, you can take the excess marinade and bring it to a boil, simmer for several minutes, and serve with the flank steak."

954,sauerkraut,https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-homemade-sauerkraut-in-a-mason-jar-193124,Clean everything.
,,,"When fermenting anything, it's best to give the good, beneficial bacteria every chance of succeeding by starting off with as clean an environment as possible."
,,,Make sure your mason jar and jelly jar are washed and rinsed of all soap residue.
,,,"You'll be using your hands to massage the salt into the cabbage, so give those a good wash, too."
,,,Slice the cabbage.
,,,"Discard the wilted, limp outer leaves of the cabbage."
,,,Cut the cabbage into quarters and trim out the core.
,,,"Slice each quarter down its length, making 8 wedges."
,,,Slice each wedge crosswise into very thin ribbons.
,,,Combine the cabbage and salt.
,,,Transfer the cabbage to a big bowl and sprinkle the salt over top.
,,,Begin working the salt into the cabbage by massaging and squeezing the cabbage with your hands.
,,,"At first it might not seem like enough salt, but gradually the cabbage will become watery and limp — more like coleslaw than raw cabbage."
,,,This will take 5 to 10 minutes.
,,,"If you'd like to flavor your sauerkraut with caraway seeds, mix them in now."
,,,Pack the cabbage into the jar.
,,,Grab handfuls of the cabbage and pack them into the canning jar.
,,,"If you have a canning funnel, this will make the job easier."
,,,"Every so often, tamp down the cabbage in the jar with your fist."
,,,Pour any liquid released by the cabbage while you were massaging it into the jar.
,,,Optional: Place one of the larger outer leaves of the cabbage over the surface of the sliced cabbage.
,,,This will help keep the cabbage submerged in its liquid.
,,,Weigh the cabbage down.
,,,"Once all the cabbage is packed into the mason jar, slip the smaller jelly jar into the mouth of the jar and weigh it down with clean stones or marbles."
,,,"This will help keep the cabbage weighed down, and eventually, submerged beneath its liquid."
,,,Cover the jar.
,,,Cover the mouth of the mason jar with a cloth and secure it with a rubber band or twine.
,,,"This allows air to flow in and out of the jar, but prevents dust or insects from getting into the jar."
,,,Press the cabbage every few hours.
,,,"Over the next 24 hours, press down on the cabbage every so often with the jelly jar."
,,,"As the cabbage releases its liquid, it will become more limp and compact and the liquid will rise over the top of the cabbage."
,,,"Add extra liquid, if needed."
,,,"If after 24 hours, the liquid has not risen above the cabbage, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of water and add enough to submerge the cabbage."
,,,Ferment the cabbage for 3 to 10 days.
,,,"As it's fermenting, keep the sauerkraut away from direct sunlight and at a cool room temperature — ideally 65°F to 75°F."
,,,Check it daily and press it down if the cabbage is floating above the liquid.
,,,"Because this is a small batch of sauerkraut, it will ferment more quickly than larger batches."
,,,"Start tasting it after 3 days — when the sauerkraut tastes good to you, remove the weight, screw on the cap, and refrigerate."
,,,You can also allow the sauerkraut to continue fermenting for 10 days or even longer.
,,,"There's no hard-and-fast rule for when the sauerkraut is ""done"" — go by how it tastes."
,,,"While it's fermenting, you may see bubbles coming through the cabbage, foam on the top, or white scum."
,,,"These are all signs of a healthy, happy fermentation process."
,,,The scum can be skimmed off the top either during fermentation or before refrigerating.
,,,"If you see any mold, skim it off immediately and make sure your cabbage is fully submerged; don't eat moldy parts close to the surface, but the rest of the sauerkraut is fine."
,,,Store sauerkraut for several months.
,,,This sauerkraut is a fermented product so it will keep for at least two months and often longer if kept refrigerated.
,,,"As long as it still tastes and smells good to eat, it will be."
,,,"If you like, you can transfer the sauerkraut to a smaller container for longer storage."
