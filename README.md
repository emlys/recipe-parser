# RecipeParser

this is a project I am doing for fun and to learn about web scraping, natural language processing, and whatever else comes up.

## Outline

- Search
  - given a recipe search term e.g. 'mac and cheese', get top results.
- Recipe parsing (in progress)
  - given a url, determine if the web page contains a recipe, and if so parse it into a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- Natural language processing of recipe instructions
  - given the text of a recipe instruction, determine the ingredients mentioned and what is done with them
- Recipe comparison
  - given multiple recipes, compare their relative proportions of ingredients and their method
- Recipe clustering
  - given a lot of recipes for the same thing, cluster them into groups that have similar ingredients/method
- Recipe averaging
  - given a lot of recipes for the same thing, generate an 'average' recipe
- UI
  - accept search input and display recipe data, comparison, average
